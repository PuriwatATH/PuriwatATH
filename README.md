# 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m a backend-focused developer with a rare combination of **financial insight, engineering execution**, and **quantitative systems thinking**.

From managing 100M+ THB in AUM as a licensed Investment Planner to designing PLC-driven automation systems — my path has converged on a mission:  
**Building scalable, secure, and intelligent trading infrastructure.**

## 🚀 Projects & Core Work

### 🧠  — *Real-time Quant Trading Simulator*
A full-stack simulation platform for traders and quant developers to test strategies in live-like conditions.

- 🔒 **Backend**: Django + FastAPI with custom middleware (Idempotency, JWT Session Tokens, ErrorHandler)
- 🔄 **Execution Engine**: WebSocket + Redis for real-time updates, SL/TP logic, and PnL calculations
- 📊 **Frontend**: React + Tailwind SPA with separate Trader / Admin / Investor (Observer Mode) views
- 🐳 **DevOps**: Dockerized, tested, and deployed with Git workflows

> ✅ Designed for performance (sub-100ms API latency) and modularity (separated layers for auth, trading logic, and PnL)

---

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python, Django, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Redis, Celery, Docker
- **Frontend**: React, TailwindCSS, WebSocket Integration
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, JWT Auth, Custom Middleware (TokenVersioning, Idempotency, API ResponseHandler)
- **Data**: Pandas, NumPy, LSTM/RL models (planned), PostgreSQL
- **Workflow & Dev**: Git, CI/CD, Agile Practices
