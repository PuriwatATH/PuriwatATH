# 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m a backend-focused developer with a rare combination of **financial insight, engineering execution**, and **quantitative systems thinking**.

From managing 100M+ THB in AUM as a licensed Investment Planner to designing PLC-driven automation systems — my path has converged on a mission:  
**Building scalable, secure, and intelligent trading infrastructure.**

## ⚒️ Tech Stack

These are the main tools I use for backend quant development:

- 🐍 Python (Data manipulation, scripting, backend APIs)
- 🧱 Django + FastAPI (Web backend + async API services)
- 🧠 Redis + PostgreSQL (Fast data access + persistent storage)
- 🧪 Pytest, Docker, Git, CI/CD (for clean deployment)
