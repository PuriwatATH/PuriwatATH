# 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m a backend-focused developer with a rare combination of **financial insight, engineering execution**, and **quantitative systems thinking**.

From managing 100M+ THB in AUM as a licensed Investment Planner to designing PLC-driven automation systems — my path has converged on a mission:  
**Building scalable, secure, and intelligent trading infrastructure.**

## 🚀 Projects & Core Work

### 🧠  — *Real-time Quant Trading Simulator*
A full-stack simulation platform for traders and quant developers to test strategies in live-like conditions.

- 🔒 **Backend**: Django + FastAPI with custom middleware (Idempotency, JWT Session Tokens, ErrorHandler)
- 🔄 **Execution Engine**: WebSocket + Redis for real-time updates, SL/TP logic, and PnL calculations
- 📊 **Frontend**: React + Tailwind SPA with separate Trader / Admin / Investor (Observer Mode) views
- 🐳 **DevOps**: Dockerized, tested, and deployed with Git workflows

> ✅ Designed for performance (sub-100ms API latency) and modularity (separated layers for auth, trading logic, and PnL)

---

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python, Django, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Redis, Celery, Docker
- **Frontend**: React, TailwindCSS, WebSocket Integration
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, JWT Auth, Custom Middleware (TokenVersioning, Idempotency, API ResponseHandler)
- **Data**: Pandas, NumPy, LSTM/RL models (planned), PostgreSQL
- **Workflow & Dev**: Git, CI/CD, Agile Practices

---

## 📈 Finance & Market Background

- ✅ **CFA Level 1**, **CFP Modules 1–4**, **SEC Thailand Investment Planner License** *(expired, reissuable)*
- 🏦 5+ years in wealth management — managed 100M+ THB AUM, referred cross-region products, navigated volatile markets
- 🎓 Selected for **Wealth STAR** program (Top 2% out of 800+ candidates)

---

## ⚙️ Engineering Execution

- Built **industrial control systems**: designed PLC automation, HVAC optimization, chemical subsystem tuning
- Delivered **QA-driven** engineering reports, stakeholder coordination, and pre-commissioning support for multi-phase projects

---

## 🔭 Why Quant?

Since 2014, I’ve built personal automated trading tools — not just for curiosity, but to solve the **system problem** in trading:

- 📊 Structuring and managing real-time market data
- ⚙️ Executing trades securely and scalably
- 💡 Designing reliable backend systems that support both real and simulated markets

## ⚒️ Tech Stack

These are the main tools I use for backend quant development:

- 🐍 Python (Data manipulation, scripting, backend APIs)
- 🧱 Django + FastAPI (Web backend + async API services)
- 🧠 Redis + PostgreSQL (Fast data access + persistent storage)
- 🧪 Pytest, Docker, Git, CI/CD (for clean deployment)
